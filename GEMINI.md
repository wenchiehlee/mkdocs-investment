# mkdocs-investment Project Context

## Project Overview
This project is a static website for personal investment documentation and blogging, built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge base ("Investment Stack") and a blog for Wen-Chieh Lee.

## Architecture & Technologies
*   **Static Site Generator:** MkDocs
*   **Theme:** Material for MkDocs (`mkdocs-material`)
*   **Plugins:**
    *   `mkdocs-git-committers-plugin-2`: Displays contributors.
    *   `mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`: Shows last update time.
    *   `mkdocs-rss-plugin`: Generates RSS feeds.
    *   `mkdocs-git-authors-plugin`: Manages post authors.
    *   `mkdocs-macros-plugin`: Allows dynamic content injection.
    *   `neoteroi-mkdocs`: Additional UI components.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (deploy-only workflow).

## Directory Structure
*   `docs/`: The root directory for documentation content.
    *   `blog/`: Contains blog posts (`posts/`) and configuration (`.authors.yml`).
    *   `reports/`: Contains automated investment reports (e.g., Dividend Analysis, Revenue Reports). **Note:** These appear to be generated by an external tool/script.
    *   `overrides/`: Custom HTML overrides for the theme.
    *   `stylesheets/` & `javascripts/`: Custom CSS/JS, including DataTables integration for sortable stock tables.
*   `mkdocs.yml`: Main configuration file.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the build environment.
*   `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD configurations (specifically for deploying to GitHub Pages).

## Development Workflow
1.  **Content Creation:**
    *   **Docs:** Create/edit Markdown files in `docs/`.
    *   **Blog:** Add new posts to `docs/blog/posts/` following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md`.
    *   **Reports:** These are generated files. Avoid manual edits unless necessary or fixing the generation template.
2.  **Local Preview:**
    *   Run `mkdocs serve` to start a local development server.
3.  **Build & Deploy:**
    *   Run `mkdocs build` to generate the static site in `site/`.
    *   Pushing to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Action to deploy to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Key Conventions
*   **Frontmatter:** All markdown files (especially blog posts and reports) use YAML frontmatter for metadata (title, date, tags, categories, authors).
*   **Tables:** Uses `DataTables` (via `tables.js`) for rich table interactions (sorting, filtering).
*   **Localization:** configured for Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`).
*   **Drafts:** Future dated posts are treated as drafts if `draft_if_future_date: true` is set in `mkdocs.yml`.
